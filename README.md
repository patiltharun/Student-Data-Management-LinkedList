## **Student Data Management System (Singly Linked List)**
 
A simple, menu-driven Student Data Management application written in C using a singly linked list. The program demonstrates dynamic memory allocation, modular programming, and binary file handling to perform CRUD operations on student records.

**Features**

- Add student record (automatic roll-number generation)
- Display all student records
- Modify a student record (by roll number)
- Delete a student record (by roll number)
- Sort records by name or percentage
- Reverse the linked list
- Save/load records to/from a binary file
- Delete all records

 

**Data Structure**

Each student record is represented by the following struct:

 
typedef struct student
{
    int rollno;
    char name[30];
    float percentage;
    struct student *next;
} ST;
 

Nodes are dynamically allocated using malloc() and freed with free() when deleted.

**Modules & Algorithms**

- Add Student
  1. Generate the smallest available roll number.
  2. Allocate memory for a new node.
  3. Read student details from the user.
  4. Insert the node at the end of the list.

- Display Students
  - Traverse the linked list and print each node.

- Modify Student
  - Find the node by roll number and update fields.

- Delete Student
  - Locate the node, re-link the list, and free memory.

- Sort Records
  - Implement sorting by name or percentage (simple O(n²) algorithms such as bubble sort or selection sort on list data, or convert to array for easier sorting).

- Reverse Linked List
  - Iterate once with three pointers (previous, current, next) and flip the next pointers.

- Save / Load Records
  - Save: open a binary file and fwrite() each record.
  - Load: fread() records and rebuild the linked list in memory.

- Delete All Records
  - Traverse and free every node, then reset head to NULL

** Future Enhancements**

- Login / authentication
- Search by name (case-insensitive)
- Export records to CSV
- GUI front-end (e.g., using GTK or a simple web UI)
- Database integration (SQLite/MySQL)
- Doubly linked list version for simpler bidirectional traversal
